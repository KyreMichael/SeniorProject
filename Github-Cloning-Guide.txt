**Team Setup Guide**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
To start working on the project, clone the GitHub repository:
```
git clone <your-repository-url>
```
Then, navigate into the project directory:
```
cd <your-repository-folder>
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required packages:
```
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
touch .env
```
Open `.env` and add the following:
```
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>

Need to get this information from me so that you will be able to login to Mongodb 
```
**Note:** Do not share these credentials publicly.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Server
Run the backend server using:
```
npx nodemon backend_auth.js
```
or
```
node backend_auth.js
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Git Commands for Collaboration

#### Fetch and Pull Latest Changes:
Before starting work, always pull the latest changes from the main branch:
```
git pull origin main
```

#### Add and Commit Changes:
After making updates, add and commit your changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

#### Push Changes to GitHub:
Push your committed changes to the main branch:
```
git push origin main
```

After finishing the feature, create a **Pull Request** to merge it into `main`.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Project on Other Devices
If you want to run the project on another device, ensure your server is listening on `0.0.0.0` in `backend_auth.js`:
```js
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log(`üöÄ Server running at http://<your-local-ip>:${PORT}`);
});
```
Find your local IP with:
```
ipconfig (Windows) | ifconfig (Mac/Linux)
```
Then access it on another device via:
```
http://<your-local-ip>:5001 or http://localhost:5001
```
